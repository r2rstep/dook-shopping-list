# dook-shopping-list

## Scope
The goal is to implement a simple, yet intelligent system for preparing a shopping list of ingredients based on the selected dish and current fridge content. Let's assume there's an intelligent fridge which knows what products it contains and is able to communicate with our system when a new product is added or removed from it by some guts
​
### Functionalities
1. As a user I want to add a recipe which contains the name of the dish and its ingredients with needed quantity
2. As a user I want to be able to choose multiple recipes and get a shopping list of the ingredients that are missing or are of insufficient quantity in my fridge
3. As a user I want the shopping list to be updated when an ingredient is added or removed from the fridge
